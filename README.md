# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance Management System (FYP)

This project was developed as my Final Year Project at the University of the Punjab. It is an AI-based Attendance Management System that uses facial recognition to automate and secure the attendance process in real-time.

## 📌 About the Project

The system captures facial data using a webcam, processes it through a trained machine learning model, and automatically marks attendance for recognized individuals. It ensures accuracy, reduces manual errors, and enhances efficiency in managing student or staff attendance records.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I worked as the **Backend Developer**, responsible for:

* Designing and implementing the **feature extraction**, **training**, and **inference pipelines**.
* Developing **Python scripts** to process and encode face data.
* Managing **data storage and model serialization** using Pickle and SQLite.
* Ensuring modular and scalable code structure for future enhancements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* OpenCV
* face\_recognition
* scikit-learn
* SQLite
* Tkinter (optional for GUI)
